# password generator

## Description
[password-generator](https://will-dean5.github.io/password-generator/)

Made a random password generator that uses uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. I used an if statement with boolean values that altered the password based on the users input. If a user inputs a number that is below 8 or higher than 128 it will say that it will not generate a password. When you click on the generate button it will prompt you to pick what kind of characters you want in the password then it will generate the random password.
